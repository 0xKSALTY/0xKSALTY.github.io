            <p id="aboutMeDetails" class="text-center">
                Hello! I'm Keelan, a Cyber Security undergraduate with a passion for all things computer science. My journey into the tech world is unique, starting with a solid foundation in the military, where I served as an Air Traffic Controller for nearly six years. This experience has honed my attention to detail, discipline, and problem-solving skills, which I now channel into the field of cybersecurity and computer science.<br><br>
            I am deeply fascinated by the endless possibilities within computer science and spend much of my spare time developing tools and applications using Python and C. Recently, I've embarked on a new learning adventure with C++.<br><br>
            Beyond programming, I enjoy participating in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and exploring challenges on platforms like Hack The Box, where I can put my skills to the test and continuously learn new techniques. My interests also extend to web development, where I dabble in both front-end and back-end technologies.<br><br>
            As I transition from my military career to fully immerse myself in the world of computer science, I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world challenges, collaborate with like-minded individuals, and contribute to the ever-evolving tech landscape. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to connecting with you!

                <p>Engaging in a hands-on experience with network configuration using Cisco Packet Tracer was useful. I enjoyed observing the real-time communication between PCs and a wireless router, it provided me with a better understanding of networks.</p>

                <p>Experimenting with changes in IP range and the default gatewayâ€™s IP address was interesting. It allowed me to gain insights into how the devices communicate and how to solve problems when they occur, for example, when changing the IP address of the default gateway, the PC no longer had internet access, this was easily fixed by disabling and reenabling the DHCP on PC0.</p>

                <p>I encountered minimal challenges during this activity, it did show me the importance of familiarising myself with the Cisco Packet Tracer interface and the location of specific devices. To enhance my skills, I have completed additional activities on the software, I am now confident with the interface.</p>
                <p>From this activity, I learned that IP configuration using DHCP is simple, due to the IP assignment being automatic. It was also interesting to see the simplicity of reconfiguring an IP address on an end device when the default gateway's IP address had been changed.</p>
                <p>This activity has given me skills to configure DHCP settings on a wireless router and end devices. Also, it has improved my understanding of the implications of altering IP parameters.</p>
